#1st Question.
After reading question number 1, there is a system in which the admin has missed some point from where I can get access to the complete server, for this to check this, I need a virtual machine to run in device, at first i didn't understand what a VM is. After knowing that, I installed the VM
and imported the drive file into it and opened the VM of sent. After getting logged in with the given data, I started to check all files first, as there may be any clue, but None was there. So i started the commands in linux.
##The approach after getting into the VM.
